# Cursor Rules

## Essential Commands

- Format and lint with `bin/fix` before committing; it installs tooling with the project's versions.
- Reset JS/TS tooling drift by running `npm ci` and matching the Node version in `.nvmrc`.
- Execute the full test suite with `bin/test`; do not call Rails test runners directly.

## Change Management

- Default to the simplest implementationâ€”only introduce abstractions or memoization when profiling proves the need.
- When cleaning code, separate existing logic from your additions and confirm scope before removing anything.
- Highlight which changes are new versus pre-existing when summarizing work.

## Generated Assets (Hands Off)

- `typings/generated/auto-import.d.ts`
- `app/helpers/routes/generated/**/*.ts`
- `db/schema.rb`
- `sorbet/rbi/dsl/**/*.rbi`
- Any path containing `generated` or marked as auto-generated

Update the source configs instead of editing these outputs (e.g., adjust auto-imports via `vite.config.ts`, routing via `config/routes.rb`, and database changes via migrations).

## AI Authorship

- When creating new files or substantially editing existing ones, add the standard header:
  ```
  /**
   * Generated by: GPT-5 Codex
   * Last modified: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss UTC
   *
   * This code was AI-generated and may require human review and testing.
   */
  ```
- Keep timestamps in UTC and refresh them on subsequent AI-assisted edits.

## Sub-Guides

- Detailed frontend, TypeScript, and Rails model instructions live in `app/AGENTS.md`.
- Create additional `AGENTS.md` files inside subdirectories that need their own rules; agents read the nearest guide.
