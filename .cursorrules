# Cursor Rules

## AI Generation Headers

- When generating new files or substantially modifying existing files, add a header comment indicating:
  - Model name that generated the code (e.g., "Claude Sonnet 4")
  - Last modified timestamp in UTC format
  - Note that the code was AI-generated and may require human review
- Use this format:
  ```
  /**
   * Generated by: [Model Name]
   * Last modified: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss UTC]
   *
   * This code was AI-generated and may require human review and testing.
   */
  ```

## Import Rules

- Don't auto-add imports if they are available in the auto-import types file (`typings/generated/auto-import.d.ts`)
- Check the global declarations in auto-import.d.ts before suggesting or adding imports for commonly used utilities and components

## TypeScript Array Access Rules

- When doing direct array access in the context of an algorithm, use non-null TypeScript assertion like `arr[i]!` as needed
- Apply non-null assertions for array access when the algorithm logic guarantees the element exists but TypeScript cannot infer this

## Function Declaration Style

- Use arrow function expressions (`const functionName = () => {}`) instead of function declarations (`function functionName() {}`)
- This applies to all functions including exported functions, utility functions, and event handlers
- Prefer `const` declarations for consistency with the codebase style
